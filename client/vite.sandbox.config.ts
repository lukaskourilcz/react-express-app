// The coding sandbox is built on its own, after the app, for one reason:
// React Testing Library needs `React.act`, and React only exports `act` from
// its DEVELOPMENT build. A production React makes RTL fall back to
// `react-dom/test-utils.act`, whose production shim calls the missing
// `React.act` and throws "act is not a function" on the first `render()` —
// so no React task could pass in a deployed build.
//
// Building this page separately keeps `process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development'`
// (and therefore the development React) inside the iframe, while the app
// itself keeps the production React it should ship. The two never share a
// React tree: the sandbox is a document of its own.
