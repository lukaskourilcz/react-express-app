// What a signed-in account leaves in this browser, and forgetting it.
//
// Learn progress and unlocks, the chosen track, quest XP and rank marks, the
// coin and shop snapshots the account sync carries, bookmarks, the perfect-quiz
// count, coding drafts, the typing best, results waiting to be recorded, the
// cached leaderboards, an invitation or voucher code and the legacy admin
// password all sit in localStorage or sessionStorage under the app's prefixes.
// After a sign-out or an account deletion the next person on the device must
// not see them, and must not have them merged into their own account when they
// sign in (lib/roadmap.ts unions unlocks and keeps the larger coin snapshot).
//
// Everything under those prefixes goes except the device's own settings below:
// they belong to the device or the person at it, not to an account, and a
// sign-in in progress needs its return path. A key added later is cleared
// unless it is listed here.
//
// Coding drafts are the one exception, and only when the sign-out was not the
// learner's choice: a session that could not refresh (expired, revoked, the
// password changed elsewhere) keeps them, under the account's id, out of
// sight. When that account signs in again they come back as the device copies
// they were, and the usual rules of coding/drafts.ts decide what opens; when
// another account signs in they are deleted unread (owner decision 4).
// Learning-path drafts kept on this device (lib/learningPathWorkspace.ts) go
// the same way: kept for that account alone, back in place as soon as it signs
// in again, deleted unread for any other.
