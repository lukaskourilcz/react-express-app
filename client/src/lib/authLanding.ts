 *    The pages an email link opens keep the learner: they say what happened
 *    and offer the way on themselves;
 *  * to /reset-password when a reset link opened a recovery session. Supabase
 *    sends that link there, or to the home page when the address is not on
 *    its allow-list; either way the learner lands on the form, once.
