// Getting a page back after its code failed to load.
//
// Every page is a lazy chunk (App.tsx). A chunk fails to load for two reasons:
// the network dropped the request, or a deploy replaced the hashed file this
// build still names. devshark.app answers a missing asset with a 404 that no
// cache keeps (vercel.json). `vite preview` answers it with index.html as
// `200 text/html`, as devshark.app did before HARDEN (docs/release-acceptance.md),
// and a module script refuses that too. Either way a stale deploy fails the
// same way a dropped request does. The route error boundary
// (components/RouteErrorBoundary.tsx) catches it inside the shell; this module
// decides how to get the page back.
//
// Asking for the same import again is not enough everywhere. Until July 2026
// the HTML standard kept a failed module fetch in the document's module map,
// so a second import() of that URL failed at once without a request
// (whatwg/html#6768, changed by whatwg/html#10327). Measured in Chromium 141
// it holds for a page chunk and for a chunk the page imports, after a network
// error, a 404 or an HTML answer. Firefox asks again from 155 (September
// 2026), Chrome from 156 (October 2026), and Safari Technology Preview 252
// does, but no Safari release yet. So a retry first asks again in place,
// which is enough where the browser forgets the failure, and reloads the
// current address when the same failure comes straight back.
// docs/release-acceptance.md has the measurements and the sources.
