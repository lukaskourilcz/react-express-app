// Motion (motion.dev, MIT) primitives - shared, bundle-conscious, and
// reduced-motion aware.
//
// Bundle discipline: we use the `m` component + LazyMotion in `strict` mode so
// the heavy DOM-animation feature set is *code-split and fetched lazily* on
// first paint rather than shipped in the initial bundle. `strict` bans the full
// `motion.*` components (which would silently pull the whole engine back in), so
// the whole app stays on the lean `m.*` path.
//
// Accessibility: every helper honours `prefers-reduced-motion` - transforms are
// dropped and only a short opacity fade remains (or nothing), so vestibular
// users don't get movement they didn't ask for.

// Fetch only the DOM animation features, and only when needed. The `m`
// component + LazyMotion core are tiny; the feature bundle loads in the
// background so it's off the critical path. Imported via a dedicated wrapper
// module (not 'motion/react' directly) so Rollup actually code-splits it out;
// see lib/motion-features for why.
//
// When that chunk does not load, no `m` element ever leaves its `initial`
// style, and every one here starts at opacity 0: the page would stay
// invisible under a working header. So a failed load marks the document
// (`<html data-motion="off">`), and app-shell.css shows each `m` element as
// its animation ends, without the animation. Every `m` element in the app
// enters to full opacity and no transform, and this module gives each a
// `data-m` attribute for that rule. Reduced motion is untouched: it only
// changes what a working animation does.
