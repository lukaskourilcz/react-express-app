// PostHog product analytics - explicit funnels and event capture.
//
// Mirrors the Sentry wiring (lib/sentry.ts): everything here is a no-op until
// VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY is set, so local/preview builds and forks with no key
// pay nothing. Unlike Sentry, the SDK is pulled in with a *dynamic* import so
// posthog-js lands in its own lazy chunk and never touches the initial bundle.
//
// Consent (lib/consent.ts): PostHog runs only after the visitor says yes to
// analytics. Before that the SDK is not downloaded, nothing is stored and
// nothing is sent; the current path and the signed-in id wait in memory so
// the pageview and the identity can follow a yes on the same page. A no, or a
// later withdrawal, resets PostHog, opts it out and removes every `ph_` /
// `__ph_` cookie and storage key and the stored campaign, including ones an
// older build wrote before the banner existed.
//
// Privacy / GDPR: we point at PostHog EU Cloud and reverse-proxy every request
// through our own /ingest path (see vercel.json). That keeps the CSP tight to
// 'self' (no third-party host) and stops ad-blockers from dropping events.
// `person_profiles: 'identified_only'` means anonymous visitors don't create
// person profiles, and `respect_dnt` honours Do-Not-Track and Global Privacy
// Control.
