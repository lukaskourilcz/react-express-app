// The Learn page's section rules, kept pure so the unit tests can hold them.
//
// A section (shared/learn-sections.ts) only decides where a topic is listed
// and, for a section the learner has not joined, that its topics are shown
// dimmed with the join action. Progress, prerequisites and the plan stay what
// they are: one progress record per topic, read in every section that lists
// it, and the server's plan check (403 not_in_plan) decides what it serves.
//
// This module ships with the Learn chunk. It is the one client module that
// reads the full registry; the initial bundle carries only
// shared/learn-section-ids.ts.
