// The FDE path's share of its section's progress figure (sections.ts,
// `pathSteps`), read by the Learn switcher and the Career page's FDE group so
// both show one figure.
//
// The path counts only while it is open for enrollment: a switched-off path,
// or a catalogue that did not load, leaves the figure to the Learn topics, as
// it was before #489. `pending` is true while an answer that would change the
// figure is still on its way, so a caller can hold the figure back instead of
// showing one number and then another.
//
// Whether the path is open is first read from the public settings the app
// asks for as it starts (`learningPaths` in /api/settings, the same verdict
// the catalogue carries per entry). While they say the path is closed, the
// 30 KB catalogue, the account's enrollments and its path progress are not
// asked at all (perf baseline #587 C06, C20): every Learn section and the
// Career page used to read them for a figure that then ignored them. The
// FDE section still reads the catalogue for its path shelf, which shows it.
