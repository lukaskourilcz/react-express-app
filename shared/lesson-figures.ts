/** Worked examples and diagrams for Learn lessons.
 *
 * Every figure here is authored, deterministic and checked. There is no
 * generated imagery anywhere in this file and there must never be: a diagram of
 * a box model, an execution order or a join is a claim about behaviour, and a
 * picture that merely looks like one is worse than no picture.
 *
 * Four rules the shapes below exist to enforce.
 *
 * **One objective per figure.** A figure belongs to one level of one topic and
 * illustrates that level's objective. A diagram that explains three things
 * explains none of them.
 *
 * **The text is not a label, it is the figure.** `alt` is the whole content in
 * words — the numbers, the order, the result — not "a diagram showing the box
 * model". Someone reading it instead of looking at it gets the same lesson, and
 * that is what makes the figure safe to lose to a narrow screen, a stylesheet
 * that did not load, or a screen reader.
 *
 * **Assumptions are stated.** A trace of execution order depends on a runtime;
 * a `fr` track depends on a container width. Where the answer would change if
 * the reader assumed something else, the figure says what to assume.
 *
 * **Nothing is decorative.** A figure is added where a relationship or a change
 * over time is clearer shown than told. Where prose is clearer, there is no
 * figure, and the coverage matrix in docs/lesson-figures.md records the
 * omissions rather than hiding them.
 *
 * A figure marked `afterSubmission` is held back until the level is finished,
 * for the case where showing it first would answer the question being asked.
 * None of the figures below is marked today; the flag exists so that an author
 * who needs it does not have to choose between the diagram and the assessment. */
