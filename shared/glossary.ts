/** The reviewed abbreviation glossary.
 *
 * devShark used to teach abbreviations as a subject: fifteen levels of what
 * letters stand for. That tests recall of expansions, which is not the thing
 * that stops a learner reading a sentence. What stops them is meeting `CORS` in
 * the middle of an explanation and not knowing what it does — and the answer to
 * that is help where the word is, not a path taken in advance.
 *
 * So the path is retired and this replaces it. Every entry is authored: the
 * expansion, one plain sentence about what it means *here*, and the domains it
 * belongs to, because plenty of these mean different things in different
 * places. Nothing is guessed, nothing is generated, and a term nobody has
 * written a definition for simply gets no help rather than an invented one.
 *
 * Two rules the matcher below enforces rather than assumes:
 *
 *   - **Word boundaries and case.** `API` matches `API`, and never the `api`
 *     inside `rapid` or a lowercase variable name.
 *   - **Not everything capitalised is an acronym.** `npm` is a name, not
 *     initials, and inventing an expansion for it would be worse than silence.
 *     The `expansion` field is optional for exactly this reason. */
