/** Concepts, and the ones worth practising against each other.
 *
 * A category is a shelf: "javascript" says where a question lives, not what it
 * teaches. Scheduling and interleaving both need the smaller unit — the thing
 * being assessed — so this file names it, and names which of them are worth
 * putting side by side.
 *
 * The pedagogical claim is narrow and it is the only one made here: when two
 * ideas are confusable, practising them apart teaches each one and practising
 * them together teaches which one applies. Learners who only ever meet `reduce`
 * in a block of `reduce` questions get very good at reaching for `reduce`.
 *
 * What this file is not: it is not a taxonomy of everything devShark teaches,
 * and it does not try to be. A question that belongs to no concept here is
 * simply scheduled and ordered as an ordinary item. Adding a group is authoring
 * work — the coverage and the gaps are written down in
 * docs/practice-scheduling.md rather than inferred from how full this file
 * looks.
 *
 * Concepts are resolved from tags the question banks already carry, so nothing
 * here duplicates authoring that exists. A tag set that does not distinguish
 * two ideas — linear search from binary search, say — does not get a group
 * pretending it does. */
