/** The order a practice session is played in.
 *
 * Scheduling decides *which* concepts are due (`shared/spaced-practice.ts`).
 * This file decides only what order they arrive in, and the two are kept apart
 * so neither can quietly become the other.
 *
 * The rule being implemented: when a learner already knows two related ideas,
 * mixing them makes the practice about choosing between them; a block of one
 * idea makes it about executing that idea. Both are useful, in that order —
 * which is why a concept the learner has just met gets a focused block before
 * it is ever mixed with anything.
 *
 * Three failure modes this arrangement is written against:
 *
 *   * A long run of one concept is a block with extra steps. Runs are bounded.
 *   * A strict alternation is a pattern, and a pattern is a hint: after three
 *     A-B-A-B pairs a learner can answer the seventh without reading it. Runs
 *     of two are therefore allowed and used.
 *   * A mix nobody can do is not interleaving, it is a wall. Only concepts the
 *     learner has already practised are eligible to be mixed.
 *
 * Deterministic throughout. The arrangement of a given set of items with a
 * given seed is always the same, which is what makes it testable and what
 * makes a resumed session look like the one that was interrupted. */
