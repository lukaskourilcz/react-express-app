/** Sections devShark no longer teaches on their own, and where their material
 * went instead.
 *
 * Three of them, retired for the same reason from three different directions:
 * each was a place where the *format* had become the subject. A Testing path
 * that spent six levels defining what a test is; an Abbreviations path that
 * asked what letters stand for; a Code Snippets path that collected language
 * tricks with nothing tying them to what the learner was building. In every
 * case the useful material belongs inside the topic it actually verifies, and
 * the standalone path was the part to remove.
 *
 * Retirement is not deletion. Three things survive it, deliberately:
 *
 *   1. **History.** A learner who passed Testing level 7 still passed it. The
 *      category stays in the subject catalogue, so old attempts, old progress
 *      and old receipts still resolve to devShark exactly as before. Only the
 *      *topic* is gone, which is what removes it from the map and the API.
 *   2. **Old links.** A bookmark to a retired topic explains where the material
 *      went and offers the destination, rather than 404ing or silently
 *      redirecting somewhere the learner did not ask for.
 *   3. **Prerequisites.** Nothing that used to depend on a retired topic is
 *      left pointing at it — see `shared/progression.ts`, where the plans name
 *      the destinations instead.
 *
 * What does not survive is delivery: nothing here may be served as a level, a
 * checkpoint, a practice pool or a recommendation. */
