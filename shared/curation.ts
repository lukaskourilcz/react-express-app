/** What "reviewed" is allowed to mean, and who is allowed to say it.
 *
 * Two gates decide whether an item stays in the active pool. Modern relevance
 * is scored across five markers, 0-2 each, out of ten; below four it leaves.
 * Quality is scored out of five across correctness, clarity, the answer
 * choices, the hint and the explanation; below three it leaves. Both must
 * pass, and passing one says nothing about the other — a question can be
 * perfectly current and still have two defensible answers.
 *
 * The harder half of this file is the part that stops the product claiming
 * more than it can show. Every learner-facing statement about review is
 * derived from a record for the *exact published version* of an item, and
 * every derivation here fails closed:
 *
 *   * No record, or a record for a different version, is not "reviewed".
 *     An edit invalidates the approval it was given, because the thing that
 *     was approved no longer exists.
 *   * "Reviewed more than once" needs more than one recorded human review.
 *     Automated validation and coding execution checks are recorded, and
 *     shown, as what they are.
 *   * A claim about the whole bank needs coverage of every source a learner
 *     can be served from. One uncountable source — a database override, a
 *     fallback pool — makes the bank-wide claim unavailable, not approximate.
 *   * A metadata failure means saying nothing, never falling back to a
 *     friendlier default.
 *
 * Nothing in the public shape carries an answer key, a hidden test, a
 * reviewer's identity or the text of an internal report. */
