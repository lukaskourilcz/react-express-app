/** Shark Cards (owner decision 12, 1 October 2026): a question a learner did
 * not know, saved where its explanation was shown, and reviewed later as a
 * card that explains the topic. The old collectible card packs are retired
 * (`op=cards` answers 410); their `user_cards` rows stay and account deletion
 * still erases them.
 *
 * A card is a `flashcards` row (migration 008): the question, its topic, and
 * the correct answer and explanation the server's grading returned once the
 * learner had answered. `/api/flashcards` stores what the learner was shown
 * after grading and serves a learner only their own cards, so a card never
 * carries an answer its owner was not already given.
 *
 * This module only works out where a card's "Learn this topic" link goes.
 * Pure, so the browser and the launch contracts share it. */
