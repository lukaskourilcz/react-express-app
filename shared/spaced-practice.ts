/** When a concept comes back, and what counts as having recalled it.
 *
 * The scheduling half of practice. It answers one question — which concepts are
 * due — and deliberately answers nothing about the order they are practised in;
 * that is `shared/interleave.ts`, and keeping the two apart is what makes both
 * testable.
 *
 * Three things this file is careful about:
 *
 * **What counts as recall.** Answering after a hint, after seeing the solution,
 * or by ordering shuffled lines is evidence of something, but it is not
 * evidence of independent retrieval. Only `independent` lengthens an interval.
 * Immediate correctness after seeing an answer is the thing spaced practice
 * exists to see through, so treating it as a success would quietly defeat the
 * feature.
 *
 * **The intervals are a starting policy, not a discovery.** Spaced retrieval
 * has strong general support; the specific hours below are ours, bounded, and
 * versioned so a later change is a new policy rather than a silent
 * reinterpretation of what learners already earned. Nothing in the product
 * presents them as optimal.
 *
 * **Missing a day is information, not debt.** Overdue concepts sort first and
 * the queue is capped, so returning after three weeks gives a normal session
 * rather than a backlog. Nothing is revoked for being late: a level a learner
 * passed stays passed. */
