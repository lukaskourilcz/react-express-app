/** Rewards: the merchandise catalogue, the crown, and the rules that keep both
 * away from anything a learner earns.
 *
 * Four physical items and one cosmetic. The physical ones are real objects that
 * cost real money to make and post, so this module describes them and refuses
 * to invent the parts nobody has supplied yet. A price, a currency, a shipping
 * region and a stock figure are **configuration**, entered once a supplier has
 * quoted them; until then every item reports `unconfigured` and cannot be
 * ordered by anyone, through any route. There is no placeholder price and no
 * pretend checkout — see `docs/rewards-launch.md` for what has to be obtained.
 * Spreadshop (sprd.net AG) prints and ships the merchandise. It cannot issue
 * discount codes, so coins redeem a whole item and never buy a discount.
 *
 * The crown is different: it is an SVG this repository draws, it ships nothing,
 * and it costs tokens alone.
 *
 * Product copy calls the tokens this module counts coins. The tables, the ops
 * and the identifiers here keep the `token` spelling.
 *
 * The invariant that outranks all of this, and the one bounded exception to it.
 *
 * **devShark is freemium, and rewards never touch learning.** `shared/tiers.ts`
 * is the only place that says what the free tier includes and what Premium
 * opens; the server refuses locked content with 402 and the client only
 * mirrors it. Premium changes which content a learner may start and nothing
 * else. Coins, the crown, collectible Shark Cards and badges change even less:
 * buying, owning and equipping change no access, no content, no grading, no
 * explanation, no XP amount, no score, no rank, no leaderboard position, no
 * matchmaking and no prerequisite. The crown is a picture.
 *
 * The exception is **streak protection**, and it is written down here rather
 * than left implicit because it is real. Two protections a month are granted
 * free, and one bridges a missed day so a streak continues instead of resetting
 * — that has been true since migration 024, long before any of it was for sale.
 * Extra protections may now be bought, and four things keep the exception
 * bounded:
 *
 *   * The currency is coins (tokens in code), earned from verified XP at 10%,
 *     doubled on Premium, and from learning milestones. No money buys a
 *     protection: it has no cash price, and a subscription only changes how
 *     fast learning earns the coins. The path is learn more, then protect a
 *     streak.
 *   * The ceiling never rises. Buying restores the same two-a-month budget and
 *     never exceeds it, so nobody can hold a deeper reserve than a learner who
 *     spends nothing.
 *   * A protection changes the day count of a streak and nothing else: no XP,
 *     no score, no rank, no badge, no access, no content.
 *   * No leaderboard in this product ranks by streak. Every one of them ranks
 *     by correct answers and accuracy, so a protected streak moves nobody up
 *     anything.
 *
 * And the reverse direction is not an exception at all: finishing a whole
 * learning path earns the merchandise package. A reward *for* learning is not a
 * purchase that affects learning, and it changes no progress. */
