/** The free tier and Premium: one contract for the browser's locks and the
 * server's refusals.
 *
 * This is the only place that says what the free tier includes. The server
 * (`lib/access.ts`) refuses locked content with HTTP 402 `premium_required`,
 * and the browser draws its locks from the same `contentTier`, so the two can
 * never disagree about a level, a part test, a coding task, an evolving stage
 * or a learning path. The module is pure: it imports nothing from `lib/`, and
 * the launch contracts fail if it ever does.
 *
 * Premium changes which content a learner may start and nothing else. Grading,
 * explanations, XP amounts, scores, streaks, ranks, leaderboards and matchmaking
 * read no tier. Drafts, bookmarks, skips and reviews of content a learner
 * already cleared are never refused, and a lapsed account keeps everything it
 * passed.
 *
 * A signed-out visitor holds the free tier, unsaved: the server refuses
 * Premium content to a guest with the same 402 as a free account, and the
 * browser draws it with the Premium mark. The landing's sample question runs in the browser; its desktop/tablet
 * coding sample uses the same sealed task and server grader as Coding, and the opening stages of every
 * project and short path are free content. */

 * reaches the technique groups the track teaches (loops, array methods,

 * short paths (three tasks in each of the eleven ten-stage projects, two in
 * each of the three FullStack apps, one in each short path), 144 of the 754
 * issued tasks, 19.1 % (JavaScript 68, TypeScript 32, React 30,
 * Algorithms 14). The DSA Foundations tasks of #493 added three: the first
 * loops and recursion tasks of the Algorithms track, which the first-task
 * rule opens, and the halving counter on the Big O levels. The second block of each track
 * came with the Easy waves of #226. The third came with its Medium and Hard waves, which
 * added no Easy task: it opens an Easy task for the techniques those
 * challenges combine most and the free set had least of (closures, recursion,
 * promises, while and sort in JavaScript; utility types and records in
 * TypeScript; custom hooks, refs, events and accessibility in React; two
 * pointers and recursion in Algorithms). When the catalogue grows, re-pick
 * here so the share stays near `FREE_CODING_SHARE.target`, and keep every
 * task already listed: a learner on the free plan may have started it. */
