/** Code-ordering puzzles: the practice a phone can actually give.
 *
 * Between quizzes on a narrow screen a code editor is the wrong instrument —
 * there is no room, and typing code on glass is a test of patience rather than
 * of understanding. Where a task has an authored puzzle, the learner arranges
 * its lines instead; where it has none, the task waits for a desktop and says
 * so, with the draft kept. Nothing is auto-passed.
 *
 * Two rules hold this honest:
 *
 *   1. **The viewport is presentation, never authorization.** The server does
 *      not read a screen size and does not care what one says: a puzzle
 *      submission is graded the same from any device, and a puzzle can never
 *      stand in for an implementation the task actually requires.
 *   2. **A puzzle proves what it proves.** Arranging authored lines shows the
 *      learner can order the steps; it does not show they could have written
 *      them. Every puzzle declares its competencies, and the evidence it
 *      produces is recorded as ordering evidence, distinct from a code pass. */
