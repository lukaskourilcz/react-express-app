/** Code snippets as a question format, rather than as a subject.
 *
 * Code Snippets used to be a devShark topic: a collection of language tricks
 * with nothing tying any of them to what the learner was building. The
 * confusion underneath it was between the *subject* — what is being learned —
 * and the *format* — how it is practised. Reading a piece of code and
 * predicting what it does is a format. It belongs inside JavaScript when it
 * teaches closures, inside React when it teaches state updates, and inside DSA
 * when it teaches what a queue costs.
 *
 * So the topic is retired and this is what replaced it: metadata a question in
 * any topic can carry, saying what language the code is in, which kind of
 * reading it asks for, and what it is teaching. Declared, not inferred — a
 * fenced code block is not by itself a snippet question, and guessing from the
 * text would make the count and the pacing meaningless.
 *
 * Reading is not writing. A snippet question is evidence that the learner can
 * follow code; the coding tasks remain the evidence that they can produce it,
 * and neither stands in for the other. That is why this lives beside the
 * question rather than inside the coding contracts. */
