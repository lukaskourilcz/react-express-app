 *
 * The server classifies with everything it knows (the expected kinds and which
 * cases the author marked as edge cases). The browser can classify the Run
 * button's immediate feedback too, with the narrower set of signals it already
 * holds; the same vocabulary and the same authored text serve both, so the
