// Shared builder for the roadmap ("Learn") question sets.
//
// The roadmap is a Duolingo-style path: eight questions per level, ordered
// easiest → hardest, up to 25 levels per topic (the level titles in
// lib/roadmap.ts set each topic's count: JavaScript runs 25, HTML 6). Each
// topic file supplies a compact `Seed[]` and this helper expands it into real
// Question objects with deterministic ids (`<prefix>-<n>`, n = seed index + 1),
// a level-derived difficulty, and a default hint. JavaScript, TypeScript and
// React author each level as four A seeds and four B seeds, which
// lib/roadmap-questions.ts interleaves; every other topic is one list of eight
// seeds per level.
//
// Level/difficulty mapping (QUESTIONS_PER_LEVEL = 8):
//   question index i (0-based) → level = floor(i/8)+1 → difficulty = ceil(level/5)
// so levels 1-5 are difficulty 1, 6-10 are 2, … 21-25 are 5. With 8 per level,
// every 5-level checkpoint covers exactly 40 questions. An id is its position,
// so a seed inserted mid-list renumbers every later question: new material for
// an existing level goes through lib/roadmap-questions-restored.ts.
