// Server-side curation metadata: the version of an item's content, and the
// review record for that exact version.
//
// The version is a keyed digest of everything authored about the item —
// question, options, correct answer, explanation, hint and tags. Keyed, not a
// plain hash: an unkeyed digest that covered the correct answer could be
// brute-forced by anyone holding the four options, which would hand out the
// answer key in a field meant to protect it. Covering the answer matters,
// because "the answer was changed" is exactly the edit that must invalidate an
// approval.
//
// The review registry is generated from the audit ledger
// (docs/audit/devshark-content-ledger.json → lib/curation-registry.ts) and is
// the only source of "this exact content was reviewed". Every devShark item a
// learner can be served passes through `questionEligibility` or
// `codingTaskEligibility` first: no record, a record for other content, a
// failed gate, a retire or a quarantine all mean the item is not served.
// Nothing downstream — the item note, the coverage sentence, the methodology
// page, the admin view — is allowed to say more than the registry supports.
