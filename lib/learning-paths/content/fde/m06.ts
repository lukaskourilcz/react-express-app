/** M06 — AI system choices.
 *
 * The module that decides how much machinery a problem actually needs. It
 * takes the integration from M02 and asks a different question about it: of
 * the four systems that answer "add AI triage" — deterministic code, one
 * model call, a workflow with a model inside it, an agent that picks its own
 * steps — which one do the stated constraints leave standing. Deterministic
 * routing is the answer more often than the request implies, and this module
 * says so in the lesson, in the checks and in the grading.
 *
 * Two lessons, one four-question check, one graded boundary validator. The
 * validator is where the second lesson lands: a model asked for JSON returns
 * a token stream that usually looks like JSON, so the parse, the field
 * checks and the range checks all live in code the learner writes.
 *
 * Every model response in this module is an authored fixture. `__RAW` in the
 * task harness is a literal object of strings; nothing here calls a provider,
 * needs a key or opens a socket. Marlbrook Systems, its ticket ids and its
 * sample figures are invented for this path. No real customer data appears
 * anywhere in it. */

import type { ModuleSource } from '../../types';

/** The authored model responses the validator is graded against. Appended
 * after the learner's code, so the fixtures cannot be shadowed by a
 * same-named declaration.
 *
 * Each string is one response Marlbrook's triage prompt produced in the
 * scenario: a clean one, one wrapped in prose and a markdown fence, one cut
 * off at the token limit, one that parses with a confidence above 1, one
 * with a category outside the queue list, one with a null where a string was
 * required, and two that carry extra fields your code has to drop rather
 * than reject. They are fixtures, not recorded provider output. */
