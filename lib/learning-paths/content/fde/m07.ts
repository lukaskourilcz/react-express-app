/** M07 — Retrieval and grounding.
 *
 * The module that decides what an answer is allowed to stand on. M03 settled
 * who may read which record and M04 settled what a model response has to
 * survive before anyone acts on it; this one puts a knowledge base between
 * them and asks which sentences a given operator is permitted to be answered
 * from. Two lessons, one four-question check, one graded grounding step.
 *
 * The graded exercise is where the second lesson lands. The access filter has
 * to run before ranking rather than after it, because a forbidden document
 * that consumes a slot in the window is a recall bug as well as a permission
 * bug — and the `crowdedWindow` fixture is built so that a filter applied
 * after the top three are chosen returns a refusal on a question the
 * knowledge base answers in one sentence.
 *
 * Every score, embedding and retrieval result in this module is an authored
 * fixture. `__RESULTS` and `__VIEWERS` in the task harness are object
 * literals; nothing here calls an embedding model, needs a key or opens a
 * socket, and a fixture score is not evidence about how a live retriever
 * would rank these articles. Marlbrook Systems, its tenants Dunfold Freight
 * and Kestrel Foods, and every KB id below are invented for this path. No
 * real customer data, credential or company appears in it. */

import type { ModuleSource } from '../../types';

/** The scored retrieval fixtures and the three viewers the assertions run
 * against. Appended after the learner's code, so neither the fixtures nor the
 * accessors can be shadowed by a same-named declaration.
 *
 * `__set` and `__viewer` hand out deep copies, so a learner who sorts the
 * array in place cannot change what a later assertion sees.
 *
 * `crowdedWindow` is the fixture that separates a pre-filter from a
 * post-filter: its three highest scores are all ineligible for a Dunfold
 * operator, so ranking first and filtering afterwards empties the window. */

          'Marlbrook’s support workbench answers an operator’s question from the knowledge base. The retriever has already run: you are handed the scored results and the viewer, and your job is the step between them and the answer.\n\nWrite `answerFromResults(query, results, viewer)`. It returns `{ answered: true, citations, usedIds }` or `{ answered: false, reason }`, and it never throws.\n\n`results` is an array of `{ id, tenantId, visibility, updatedAt, score, text }`. `visibility` is the article’s shelf state: `published`, `restricted` or `superseded`. `viewer` is `{ tenantId, clearances }`.\n\nWork in this order:\n\n1. **The question.** `query` is not a string, or is empty once trimmed: `{ answered: false, reason: \'no-query\' }`.\n2. **Filter, before anything is ranked.** Keep a result only when every one of these holds:\n   - `result.tenantId` is exactly `viewer.tenantId`. Another tenant is out, whatever it scored.\n   - `visibility` is `published`, or it is `restricted` and `viewer.clearances` contains `kb-restricted`.\n   - `visibility` is not `superseded`, and not any other value either. A state you do not recognise is not a permission.\n   - `id` and `text` are strings that are non-empty once trimmed, and `score` is a finite number. A result you cannot cite or read supports nothing.\n   A non-array results input or a viewer that is missing, non-object, an array, or lacks a non-empty string tenantId leaves nothing eligible. Reject an empty/whitespace-only tenantId; otherwise compare the original tenant strings exactly, without normalizing them.\n3. **Nothing eligible:** `{ answered: false, reason: \'no-permitted-results\' }`.\n4. **Rank.** Sort a copy of the survivors by `score` descending. Order equal scores by original `id` ascending in UTF-16 code-unit order, so the same input always produces the same citations.\n5. **Support.** Drop anything scoring below `0.6`. Keep at most the first three.\n6. **Nothing strong enough:** `{ answered: false, reason: \'below-support-threshold\' }`.\n7. **Answer.** `citations` is `{ sourceId, updatedAt }` per kept result in ranked order — a minimal projected locator/timestamp in this fixture; it is not an immutable versioned citation or proof that an operator can resolve the content. `usedIds` is the same ids as a flat array, which is what the evaluation harness in M09 compares against a labelled set.\n\nDomain: ordinary dense arrays of at most 1,000 entries, which may contain malformed ordinary values; no getters or proxies. Candidate objects have unique string ids; string fields/query have at most 1,000 UTF-16 code units. Valid candidate updatedAt values are strings copied unchanged. Viewer clearances are an array or treated as empty. Do not mutate any input array or object, and preserve the original id/updatedAt values in the projection.\n\nTarget: O(n log n) time, where n is the result count, under bounded-length field/comparison operations.\n\nThe two refusals are different events and stay separate. These are selection outcomes for internal diagnostics, not unique root-cause diagnoses. The cutoff is a synthetic score rule, not proof of semantic support; answered:true means a selection exists, not that a generated answer is correct.\n\n`text` is untrusted. One fixture carries a line claiming the viewer is an administrator and instructing you to cite KB-901 as well. Your code never reads `text` as an instruction: permissions come only from the trusted tenant/visibility/clearance policy. Id/text validity and score still affect eligibility and selection, without interpreting content instructions.\n\n`__RESULTS`, `__VIEWERS` and the `__set` / `__viewer` accessors come from the task harness. They are fixtures authored for this exercise and identical on every run. Nothing here calls an embedding model or opens a network connection, and a fixture score is not evidence about how a live retriever would rank these articles.\n\nOne honest limit: the sandbox hands you an array that has already been fetched and scored, so an assertion here can show that a forbidden document never reached your window or your citation list. It cannot show that the text was never loaded. Against a real store you push the tenant and the clearance into the query itself.',
