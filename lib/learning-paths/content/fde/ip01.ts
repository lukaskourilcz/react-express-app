Common tenant/item/revision errors keep their existing precedence.\n\nFor a newer valid rename, the named asset must exist and be active. Otherwise return `rename:not-found` or `rename:retired`. Return a fresh record with the new revision, label and lastChange, preserving tenantId, itemId, location and status. The change fingerprint is exactly JSON.stringify of `[kind,tenantId,itemId,revision,label]`; the human description is `<tenantId>/<itemId>: rename to <label>`.\n\nPreserve applyCsv’s existing version policy before application: older revisions are stale; equal revision and equal normalized command is a duplicate; equal revision with different content rejects the whole batch as `revision:conflict`. A rename never creates, moves, revives or crosses tenants. The entire batch stages atomically: any parse/application error returns errors without a partially applied result, and caller snapshots are never changed, including frozen records/arrays. Existing create/move/retire, exports, row order and counts remain as supplied.\n\nDomain: ordinary strings in the stated six-unquoted-field CSV dialect, typed valid snapshots (possibly frozen), at most 100 change rows and 500 snapshot records. Label length is at most 100 after trimming; commas/newlines are not valid field data. This exercise does no I/O or actual asset operation.",

      "Follow the existing move command through the union, parser, fingerprint and application. Rename changes a different field.",
