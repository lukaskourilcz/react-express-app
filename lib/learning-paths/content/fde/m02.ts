/** M02 — Integration and data.
 *
 * The first module that runs code. It takes the scope written in M01 and
 * points it at an external system that does not behave the way its
 * documentation says: fields that are documented as present and are not,
 * pages behind a cursor, the same ticket delivered twice, and a throttled
 * response that has to be waited out rather than dropped.
 *
 * Two lessons, one four-question check, one graded connector adapter. The
 * adapter is the vertical slice this path is proved with, so its criteria are
 * split three ways — correctness, replay, throttling — and each failure
 * detail names the mistake rather than the missing line.
 *
 * The ticket API is a fixture. `client.listTickets` is an object literal
 * declared in the task harness, `sleep` runs on the sandbox's virtual clock,
 * and nothing here opens a socket or needs a vendor account. Marlbrook
 * Systems, its ticket ids and its customer ids are invented for this module.
 * No real customer data appears anywhere in it. */

import type { ModuleSource } from '../../types';

/** The synthetic ticket API the adapter is graded against, plus the probes
 * the assertions read. Appended after the learner's code, so `sleep` and the
 * client builders cannot be shadowed by a same-named declaration.
 *
 * `sleep` schedules through `setTimeout`, which the sandbox runs on a virtual
 * clock: a 500 ms wait finishes in microseconds and the recorded request
 * times still show the gap, so the same submission grades the same way every
 * run. */

The truncation answer describes a partial response, which is what ranged requests and 206 are for; a 429 may include an explanatory error body rather than a successful page.

Hashing the whole payload fails for the same reason one level down, because `deliveryId` and `deliveredAt` differ between attempts, so the hash differs too; a canonical content hash can sometimes help under a documented content-deduplication policy, but is not a general replacement for stable event/version identity when separate updates can have equal content.

Each ticket carries `id`, `customerId`, `subject` and fields you do not need.\n\nFour things go wrong on the way, and all four are graded:\n\n1. **A ticket you cannot use.** Trim `id` and `customerId`. If either is not a string or is empty after trimming, do not keep the ticket: add one to `skipped` and move on. A ticket you skipped never becomes a record, so a second delivery of it is skipped again rather than counted as a duplicate.\n2. **The same ticket twice.** One id arrives on two different pages. Keep the first copy exactly as it was, add one to `duplicates`, and do not overwrite anything.\n3. **Three pages behind a cursor.** An empty `tickets` array does not mean the walk is over. Only a `nextCursor` of `null` does.\n4. **A throttled page.** One call rejects with `{ status: 429, retryAfterMs }`. In this fixture no page was returned, so the page still has to be fetched: `await sleep(retryAfterMs)`, then request the same cursor again. Give a page at most three retries; if it is still throttled after that, let the rejection reach your caller. A rejection whose status is not 429 is never retried and always propagates.\n\nA kept record is exactly `{ id, customerId, subject }` with the trimmed id and customer id, and `subject` copied through unchanged. Sort `records` by `id` ascending, comparing their UTF-16 code units with ordinary < and > (not locale collation), so `TCK-10` sorts before `TCK-9`.\n\nRun `syncTickets` twice on the same client and it must return the same thing both times, with the same counts. Keep every array, set and counter inside the function.\n\nInput bounds: 1–20 finite cursor-linked pages, at most 50 ordinary ticket objects per page; no cycles, getters or proxies. Non-null cursors are strings. Subjects are strings copied unchanged; string fields have at most 1,000 UTF-16 code units. A throttle delay is finite and nonnegative. Do not mutate the returned page or ticket objects.\n\nTarget: O(n log n) time, where n is the total page and ticket count, using bounded-length text comparisons and the usual hash-set cost model; network/virtual waiting is excluded.\n\nThe client is a fixture written for this exercise, not a live API. `sleep` runs on the sandbox’s virtual clock, so a 500 ms wait finishes instantly and still records as a 500 ms gap.
