/** M08 — AI security.
 *
 * M05 decided what a retriever is allowed to return. M06 put a gate in front
 * of every tool call. This module is about the sentence that survives both:
 * an instruction somebody wrote into a document, a ticket or a tool response,
 * hoping your handler reads it as a command rather than as text.
 *
 * Two lessons, two checks, one graded repair. The first lesson is about where
 * untrusted content enters and why a delimiter is not a boundary. The second
 * is about how much one wrong call can destroy, about writing the adversarial
 * case as a test rather than as a paragraph in a design document, about the
 * sandbox a code-running tool needs, and about the compliance vocabulary
 * (SOC 2, HIPAA, FedRAMP) a customer's security review uses. The second check
 * (#504) grades that vocabulary as questions a review asks of a deployment,
 * never as legal advice, together with the sandbox and runtime-safety cases.
 *
 * One claim is repeated on purpose, in both lessons and in the exercise: prompt defenses can help, while execution authority must be enforced outside
 * the model. The fixture checks a bounded policy, not complete export safety.
 *
 * Everything the exercise touches is an authored fixture. `__fixture` in the
 * task harness builds one session, three knowledge-base articles and a
 * recording `sendExport` tool; nothing calls a provider, needs a key or opens
 * a socket. Marlbrook Systems, its tenants, its article ids and the address
 * `grants-review@nowhere.example` are invented for this path. No real
 * customer data, credential or company appears in any of it, and a fixture
 * that refuses an injection is evidence about this code path on these inputs,
 * never a measurement of live model behaviour. */

import type { ModuleSource } from '../../types';

/** The session, the retrieved set and the recording tool the repair is graded
 * against. Immutable helper APIs are installed before learner declarations;
 * deferred instrumentation runs after declarations and before graded calls.
 *
 * Three articles, chosen so every criterion has something to bite on: KB-118
 * is the operator's own published article and the only legitimate support for
 * an export, KB-204 is superseded, and KB-902 is a published article
 * belonging to the other tenant whose text carries the injected instruction.
 * `supportText` swaps the injected sentence into KB-118 as well, so a test can
 * prove that the article's wording changes nothing. `calls` records every
 * invocation of the tool, which is how an assertion shows that a refusal never
 * reached the handler at all. */

          'Repair `runAction(session, proposal, documents, tools)`, the last step of Marlbrook’s support workbench. The model has already proposed an action; this function decides whether it happens.\n\n`session` is trusted current context supplied by the server for this fixture policy: `{ tenantId, operatorId, contacts }`, where `contacts` is the tenant’s own address book as an array of `{ label, email }`. `proposal` is model output: `{ action, tenantId, actor, recipient, sourceId }`, and every field in it was written by the model. `documents` is the retrieved set that was placed in the model’s context, as `{ id, tenantId, visibility, text }`. The fixture array includes records this session may not read. Its identity/tenant/visibility metadata comes from the trusted collector, while document text is attacker-influenced; the proposal cannot grant authority or rewrite that collector metadata. `tools` exposes one effect, `sendExport(input)`, which returns `{ receiptId }`.\n\nThe version you have been given executes on the happy path, and the scratch pad shows what it costs. It scans the retrieved text for an approval phrase and skips its own checks when it finds one, it takes the tenant and the actor straight from the proposal, it mails whatever recipient the proposal named, and it accepts any document in the set as evidence. Repair all four.\n\nWork through these gates in order and stop at the first refusal.\n\n1. **Known action.** `proposal.action` must be exactly `export.send`. Anything else, including a missing proposal, returns `{ ok: false, reason: \'unknown_action\' }` and touches no tool.\n2. **Evidence this session may read.** `proposal.sourceId` must name an entry of `documents` whose `tenantId` equals `session.tenantId` and whose `visibility` is exactly `published`. Otherwise `{ ok: false, reason: \'evidence_not_visible\' }`. A `superseded` article, a state you do not recognise, an id that is not in the set, and a `documents` that is not an array all land here — a shelf state you have never seen is not a permission.\n3. **Recipient on the allow-list.** Compare `proposal.recipient`, trimmed and lower-cased, against the emails in `session.contacts` compared the same way. No match, or a recipient that is not a string, gives `{ ok: false, reason: \'recipient_not_allowed\' }`.\n4. **Execute.** Call `tools.sendExport` with exactly `{ tenantId, actor, recipient, sourceId }`, where `tenantId` is `session.tenantId`, `actor` is `session.operatorId`, `recipient` is the address as your contact list stores it rather than as the model wrote it, and `sourceId` is the matched document’s `id`. Return `{ ok: true, action: \'export.send\', receipt: <the receiptId the tool returned> }`.\n\nNothing inside `documents[].text` may change any of this. One fixture article carries a line claiming an administrator pre-approved the export and naming an outside address; a run against it must produce the same result and the same tool call as a run against ordinary article text. Within the stated domain, runAction returns the defined result without throwing. Known actions always receive valid trusted session/tools; malformed proposal/documents/recipient cases are handled as described.\n\n`__INJECTION`, `__fixture` and `__twice` are immutable helpers provided by the task harness before your code runs. Instrumentation is installed after your declarations and before the graded calls. They are authored fixtures, identical on every run: one session, three knowledge-base articles and a `sendExport` that records its input. Nothing here calls a model, a provider or a network, so a passing assertion says this code path refused these inputs — it is not a measurement of how a live model would behave against the next phrasing.\n\nDomain: at most 1,000 ordinary retrieved entries and 1,000 contacts, with bounded strings of at most 1,000 UTF-16 units and unique nonempty document ids. Current session tenant/operator ids are valid strings. Other inputs are ordinary data without getters/proxies, except the ignored proposal.tenantId, proposal.actor and document.text fields may be accessors that throw if read. Do not read or enumerate those ignored fields, and do not mutate any input. The synthetic sendExport is synchronous and returns a valid receipt without throwing. Recipient matching is this exercise’s trim/lowercase address-book policy, not general email validation; send the first matching contact’s original email string.\n\nTarget: O(n) time, where n is the combined document/contact count, using bounded-length field operations.\n\nThese three gates do not verify the original intent to export, human consent, current grants, data minimization or real delivery. Those require a production authorization workflow outside this fixture.\n\nOne more thing that is true even after the repair passes: a stronger instruction in the system prompt would not have changed a single assertion below, because none of the gates reads the prompt. That is the point of the exercise.',
