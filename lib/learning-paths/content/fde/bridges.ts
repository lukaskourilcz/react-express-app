/** Bridges — the optional practice a diagnostic gap points at.
 *
 * Every activity here carries purpose 'diagnostic': a bridge closes a gap the

 * module is optional and holds no requirements, so a learner who already works
 * across the backend, the operator screen, delivery and Python can skip it
 * whole and lose nothing.
 *
 * Four activities, one per bridge in `fde.ts`: a TypeScript mapping exercise
 * for Backend and data, a reducer for Operator interface, an incident case for
 * Delivery operations, and five Python reading questions for Python
 * interoperability.
 *
 * Every payload, timeline and snippet is a fixture written for this exercise.
 * No customer data, no live system, no vendor account, and no Python runs on
 * the server — the Python questions grade reading, and anything a learner runs
 * locally stays their own self-reviewed note. */

Change 41c7, released 2026-06-11: "cache resolved knowledge-base article lookups in memory"

09:02  41c7 rolled out to 3 of 12 instances (canary).
09:05  Canary p95 latency 410 ms, unchanged. Error rate 0.2%, unchanged.
09:20  Rollout completed on all 12 instances.
11:40  The support lead reports two tickets from tenant NORTHWIND showing an
       article that belongs to tenant CALDERA. No alert has fired.
11:52  On-call opens the dashboards: request rate, error rate, p95 latency and
       CPU are all inside the normal range for a Thursday.
12:05  Traces show the article-lookup span returning in 1 ms for a repeated
       query and 90 ms for a first-time query, for every tenant.
12:14  The cache key is read off the span attributes. It is the article slug.
       The tenant id is not part of it.
12:20  41c7 rolled back on all instances. Repeated lookups return to 90 ms.
12:26  New cross-tenant reads stop. Two support replies quoting the CALDERA
       article were already sent; one of them went out by email.`;

          'Brightpier Freight exports account records to your integration. The export has the shape real exports have: fields go missing, a date arrives as an empty string, the id is sometimes a number and sometimes a string of digits, and a plan name turns up that your system has never heard of.\n\nWrite `mapAccount(raw)`. It takes one raw record and returns a discriminated result: `{ ok: true, record }` when every field survives validation, and `{ ok: false, problems }` when one or more do not. Never both, and never a half-filled record sitting next to a problem list.\n\nTrim every string field before you check it. The rules:\n\n- `account_id` becomes `record.id`, a non-negative safe integer (0 through Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER). A safe numeric integer passes as it is; a trimmed ASCII digit string is converted only if its result is in that range, and anything else is the problem `account_id must be a whole number`.\n- `company_name` becomes `record.companyName` and must be non-empty after trimming, or the problem is `company_name must not be empty`.\n- `owner_email` becomes `record.ownerEmail`, trimmed and lowercased, and must contain `@`, or the problem is `owner_email must contain @`.\n- `signed_up_at` becomes `record.signedUpAt`. Missing, `null` and an empty string all mean `null` — this export uses those values for an unknown sign-up date; do not infer why it is missing or invent today’s date. Any other value must be a string matching the digit pattern `YYYY-MM-DD` after trimming (shape only, not calendar-date validation), or the problem is `signed_up_at must be YYYY-MM-DD`.\n- `plan` becomes `record.plan` and must be exactly `starter`, `growth` or `enterprise`. Anything else, `Growth` included, is the problem `plan must be one of starter, growth or enterprise`.\n\nCollect every problem rather than returning the first one: whoever fixes the export wants the whole list in one pass. Sort the list alphabetically using the default string order before returning it. A fixed field-check order can also be deterministic, but this contract requires canonical alphabetical order.\n\nTarget: O(n) time, where n is the total input string length, under a character-processing model.\n\nThe records here are fixtures written for this exercise.

It has to change nothing. The same goes for a response whose `requestId` does not match the one in flight, which is what a superseded request looks like.\n\nAny action the current status does not allow — an unknown type included — returns the state object it was given, unchanged and identical.
