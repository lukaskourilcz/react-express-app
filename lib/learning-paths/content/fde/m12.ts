/** M12 — Production delivery.
 *
 * M07 produced a number that says whether the change helped. M08 produced a
 * handler that refuses to act on text it cannot trust. This module is the
 * week after both of them ship: the signal that shows the failure before a
 * customer does, the rollout that can be stopped, the trace that says which
 * dependency ate the request, and the rollback that leaves three things
 * behind.
 *
 * Two lessons, one four-question check, one graded retry-and-circuit helper.
 * The first lesson is about what logs, metrics and traces each answer, and
 * about working backwards from the failure you expect to the one signal that
 * would catch it. The second is about the incident: mitigate before you
 * diagnose, read the trace to the span holding the latency, and know what
 * redeploying the old build does not undo.
 *
 * One claim runs through both lessons and lands in the check: a health probe
 * that asserts a 200 proves the service answers, not that the answers are
 * right. The router failure this module keeps returning to is a 200 with a
 * shrug in it; the stated upper-latency/error monitors do not detect it.
 *
 * Everything the exercise touches is an authored fixture. `__dependency` in
 * the task harness replays a scripted list of outcomes and `sleep` runs on
 * the sandbox's virtual clock, so a 2 000 ms cooldown resolves instantly and
 * the recorded gaps still read 100, 200, 300. Nothing here opens a socket,
 * needs a key or calls a provider. Marlbrook Systems, its endpoints, its
 * release numbers and its trace ids are invented for this path; no real
 * customer data, credential or company appears in any of them. A fixture
 * dependency that fails on cue is evidence about this code on these inputs,
 * never a measurement of how a live service degrades. */

import type { ModuleSource } from '../../types';

/** The scripted dependency, the circuit builder and the two probes the
 * assertions read. Immutable helpers are supplied before learner declarations;
 * deferred instrumentation initializes before graded calls.
 *
 * A plan is one entry per call — `'o'` resolves, `'5'` rejects 503, `'t'`
 * rejects 429, `'4'` rejects 422, `'x'` rejects with no status at all, and a
 * number rejects with that status. When the plan runs out its last entry
 * repeats, so `'5'` alone means a dependency that never recovers and `'444o'`
 * means three refusals and then a working probe. `sleep` schedules through
 * `setTimeout`, which the sandbox runs on a virtual clock: the cooldown
 * finishes in microseconds and the recorded call times still show the gap, so
 * the same submission grades the same way on every run. */

Write the bounded retry/circuit helper; it does not by itself establish a global traffic limit or service recovery.\n\n`createCircuit(options)` returns `{ send, state }`. `options` carries `call`, `failureThreshold`, `windowMs`, `cooldownMs`, `retries`, `baseDelayMs` and `maxDelayMs`. `call(request)` may throw synchronously or return a settling promise; a rejection may carry a numeric `status`.\n\n**`send(request)`** returns a promise that always resolves, never rejects, with one of three shapes:\n\n- `{ ok: true, value, attempts }` — `value` is what `call` resolved with.\n- `{ ok: false, reason: \'failed\', status, attempts }` — `status` is the numeric `status` of the last rejection, or `null` when it carried none.\n- `{ ok: false, reason: \'circuit-open\', attempts: 0 }` — refused without calling through.\n\n`attempts` counts the calls this `send` made to `call`.\n\n**Retrying, while the circuit is closed.** A rejection is retryable when its `status` is 429, when its `status` is 500 or above, or when it carries no numeric `status` at all. This exercise’s policy does not retry any other numeric status: one call, then give up. That is a fixture rule, not a universal HTTP retry rule. A retryable failure waits `Math.min(baseDelayMs * 2 ** (attempt - 1), maxDelayMs)` milliseconds with `await sleep(...)` and tries again, for at most `retries` retries — so `retries: 2` means three calls at most, with waits of `baseDelayMs` and `2 × baseDelayMs`, each capped at `maxDelayMs`.\n\n**Opening.** A whole `send` that ends `ok: false, reason: \'failed\'` counts as one failure, however many attempts it made. Count consecutive failures: when a failure arrives more than `windowMs` after the previous one, the streak restarts at 1 instead of continuing. A successful `send` clears the count. Reaching `failureThreshold` opens the circuit and starts the cooldown. A refused `send` is not a failure and never touches the count.\n\n**Open, and the probe.** While the circuit is open, `send` returns `circuit-open` immediately and `call` is not invoked at all. Once `cooldownMs` has passed since it opened, the circuit is half-open: the next `send` is the probe, and it is exactly one call with no retries. Any other `send` arriving while that probe is in flight is refused. A probe that resolves closes the circuit and clears the failure count; a probe that rejects re-opens it and restarts the cooldown from that moment.\n\nDomain: options are trusted immutable configuration: failureThreshold is an integer from 1 to 100; retries is an integer from 0 to 8; windowMs, cooldownMs, baseDelayMs and maxDelayMs are integer durations from 0 to 100,000. Status values, when present, are finite integers from 100 to 599; errors can also be null, primitives or ordinary objects with no numeric status. call may throw synchronously or settle a promise, and settles within the sandbox budget; sleep resolves. Requests/results are opaque values forwarded unchanged. Closed-state sends are sequential: only half-open sends overlap in this exercise. Do not mutate configuration or requests. Multiple already in-flight closed sends, cancellation, distributed coordination and real request deadlines are outside this contract. There is no single input-size target for this stateful helper; its per-send attempt budget is explicit.\n\n**`state()`** returns `\'closed\'`, `\'open\'` or `\'half-open\'` — `\'half-open\'` meaning the cooldown has passed and the next `send` will be the probe.\n\nThe helper sleep and __dependency/__circuit/__gaps/__drive APIs are immutable harness helpers available before declarations, with deferred instrumentation initialized before graded calls. Do not redefine them.\n\nThe dependency is a fixture written for this exercise, not a live service. `sleep` runs on the sandbox’s virtual clock, so a 2 000 ms cooldown finishes instantly and the recorded gaps between calls still read 100, 200 and 300. Nothing here opens a network connection, and a fixture that fails on cue tells you about this code on these inputs rather than about how a real store degrades.',
