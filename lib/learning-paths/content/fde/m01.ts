/** M01 — Customer discovery.
 *
 * The first module of the FDE path, and the one every later module quotes
 * back: who does the work today, what it costs them, and what this project
 * has agreed not to do. Two lessons, one four-question check, and two written
 * pieces: the one-page scope (workflow, questions, baseline, success metric,
 * scope, sequencing, non-goals, risks, acceptance) and a capped executive
 * update (audience, decisions, open questions, next step).
 *
 * Nothing here is machine-gradable beyond the check. Both written pieces are
 * artifacts: the server confirms every required field is present and inside
 * its length cap, records the submission as self-reviewed, and says plainly
 * that a character count cannot judge a baseline or an update. The module
 * requires both, so guided completion waits for them.
 *
 * The practitioner sources (Qureshi, The Pragmatic Engineer, PostHog, and
 * the Vercel posting) were read in October 2026 and are cited
 * for what they say, never as a hiring standard.
 *
 * Marlbrook Systems, its ticket volumes, its shadowing clock and its
 * transcript are fixtures written for this module. No customer data, no live
 * system, no vendor account. */

        brief:
          'Marlbrook Systems sells warehouse software to mid-sized distributors. Its VP of Customer Operations has sent one line: “Add AI to support.” Four agents handle roughly 400 tickets a month. The shadowing session in lesson one is the only measurement available for this submission, and it covered a single ticket. The separate multiple-choice baseline note is hypothetical; do not treat it as collected project evidence.\n\nWrite the one page that comes out of a discovery week. Nine fields, all required, each with a character limit you can see before you type: the workflow as it runs today (2,000), five questions you would ask before writing any code (1,200), the baseline (400), the success metric (600), what is in scope for this phase (1,200), the order you would deliver it in (1,200), what is not in scope (1,200), the risks (2,000), and the acceptance condition that gates launch (1,500).\n\nYou review it against two rows of the path rubric, shown beside the form: problem framing and communication.\n\nThe company, the volumes, the clock and the transcript are fixtures written for this module. There is no live system to query and no customer to interview, so where you would have to ask someone, write the question down rather than inventing the answer. Label one-ticket observations as preliminary; where a broader baseline or acceptance target has not been agreed, give a measurement/proposal plan and name the missing decision instead of claiming it already happened.\n\nThis submission is recorded as self-reviewed. The automated check confirms that each required field is present and inside its length limit, and that is the whole of what it establishes: it cannot judge whether your baseline is measurable, whether your questions would change anything, or whether you excluded the right things. Read your own answer against the problem framing and communication rows of the path rubric, then revise it before you move on.',

The VP of Customer Operations, who sent “Add AI to support”, meets the chief operating officer on Monday to decide whether the project keeps its budget, and has asked you for an update to forward.\n\nWhat the fixtures give you: one shadowed ticket took nineteen minutes, ten of them on finding the account and its plan. Your scope brief proposes the account lookup first, then routing, then a suggested reply that an agent sends. The security reviewer has not seen the design. The CRM data owner has not granted read access. Finance has not named an approver for anything that moves money, so refunds stay a non-goal. Nobody has agreed a success metric yet. Use only these facts; where you would need an answer you do not have, list it as an open question with an owner.\n\nFour fields, all required, each with its own character limit so the update fits on a phone screen: the audience (200), the decisions you need (600), the open questions (600) and the next step (300), 1,700 in all.
