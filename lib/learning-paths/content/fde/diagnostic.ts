/** FDE — the optional placement diagnostic.
 *
 * Twelve authored scenarios and two short debugging exercises, arranged so a
 * learner finds out where they already stand before committing forty hours.
 * It is skippable by design: the module carries no requirements, no activity
 * here gates anything, and passing it grants no exemption from a bridge or a
 * module. What it produces is a recommendation.
 *
 * The scenarios split four ways, three items each: APIs and data, security
 * and operations, the operator's screen, and evaluating an AI-assisted
 * result. Every question tags the competencies it touches, because the
 * per-competency report is built from those tags. A competency no question
 * carries comes back as `not_assessed` — never as a zero, which would claim a
 * measurement nobody made.
 *
 * Both coding exercises hand the learner code that is already broken and say
 * so. Every page, delay and outcome they meet is a synthetic in-memory
 * fixture built in the task harness. No network, no vendor, no live model.

It compiles, the tests fail, and the reason is the narrowing.\n\n`SyncOutcome` has three members: an `applied` record, a `queued` record with a `retryAfterMs` delay, and a `rejected` record with an `error`. `describeOutcome` turns one into a line of text:\n\n- applied → `applied r-1`\n- queued → `queued r-2 in 500ms`\n- rejected → `rejected r-3: MISSING_VAT`\n\nThe starter tests `outcome.state !== \'queued\'`, which is true for `applied` and for `rejected` alike, so every rejected record is described as an applied one. A failure reported as a success is the defect: nothing throws, and the sync log reads clean.\n\nFix the narrowing so each state is decided by its own name. The compiler is graded too, so the types have to stay clean.\n\nInputs have ordinary data properties and one of the three declared states. recordId and error are strings of at most 10000 UTF-16 code units, possibly empty; queued delay is a whole Number from 0 through Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER. Extra unrelated fields may exist at runtime and do not choose the branch. Preserve all input fields, own properties, descriptors and prototypes, including on frozen input. Keep string contents exactly, with no trimming or normalization. Target: O(n) time in the output-character model, where n is the total number of UTF-16 code units materialized in the result.
