Three reports are reproducible: a card from another tenant can influence a quote, a repeated request id with changed shipment data is silently ignored, and a batch containing an invalid request can still report successful quotes. Inspect the full call path before changing it; preserve the existing public functions.\n\nContract: process requests in input order. Before pricing a request, require request.tenantId equal to actorTenantId; otherwise append `request:<id>:wrong-tenant` and continue. Card lookup uses both the actor tenant and request.cardId. No match appends `request:<id>:unknown-card`; multiple matching cards append `request:<id>:ambiguous-card`. Other tenants’ same-named cards do not create ambiguity or supply a price.\n\nFor authorized requests, identity is requestId plus the exact values of cardId and shipment id, zone, weightGrams, declaredValueCents and flags in input order. The first occurrence claims that id even if pricing later fails. An exact repeated payload counts one duplicate and is not priced again. A changed payload under that id appends `request:<id>:conflict`. Identity comparison must use those field values rather than object property insertion order.\n\nCall the existing quote() for each unique authorized request with exactly one own-tenant card. Prefix each returned error with `request:<id>:`. Success plans exactly `{requestId,cardId,currency,total}`. Accumulate errors in request order. If any error exists, return only `{ok:false,errors}`: no partial quotes or duplicate count. Otherwise return `{ok:true,quotes,duplicates}`. No caller object or array may change, including frozen inputs. Empty requests succeed with empty output.\n\nDomain: valid typed request/card wrappers, ordinary data, nonempty actor/request/card ids, at most 100 requests/cards, and the existing bounded pricing fields.

Reports say a caller can submit another tenant’s command, preview mode returns records as if changes were committed, and equal-revision changed payloads are silently classified as stale. Preserve earlier CSV parsing, application errors, output ordering and atomic batch behavior.\n\nParse the entire CSV first; return its parser errors unchanged if malformed. Before applying any row, refuse EVERY row whose command.tenantId differs from actorTenantId with {ok:false,errors:[{row:<CSV row>,code:'tenant:forbidden'}, ...]}, in row order. The snapshot may contain records from other tenants; preserve those records unchanged. Invoke applyCsv only after authorization succeeds. If it rejects, return that rejection without partial records. On success, commit mode returns its staged records. Preview mode instead returns copies of the original snapshot in original order, while counts and changes describe the hypothetical application. Both modes leave caller inputs unchanged; neither writes to any store.\n\nWithin applyCsv, lower revision means stale, exact equal-revision fingerprint means duplicate, and equal revision with a different fingerprint means revision:conflict. These rules apply in both modes. Domain: the existing valid snapshot and bounded CSV grammar, nonempty actor tenant, mode 'preview' or 'commit'. The helpers intentionally support create/move/retire only; no rename extension is required.",
