/** M05 Data plumbing (temporary file and id until B9 renumbers the path).
 *
 * The module between the integration modules and the model modules. M02
 * taught a connector to survive one messy feed; this one moves records
 * between systems with SQL, legacy exports and a paginated API, and keeps
 * the result honest under replay.
 *
 * Two lessons, one six-question SQL reading check, one graded TypeScript
 * reconciliation. devShark runs no SQL (decision D5 in the flagship plan),
 * so SQL is graded as reading: every table, query result, export row and
 * API page is a fixture written for this module, and the lessons say so.
 *
 * The reconciliation splits its criteria four ways, all critical: the
 * validated record shape, a count for every row read, the same ledger
 * whatever order the batches replay in, and a failed walk that writes
 * nothing. A dropped row or an order-dependent merge cannot be averaged
 * away by a correct record shape.
 *
 * Kestrel Lane Supply, its customers, account ids and addresses are
 * invented. Email addresses use the reserved `.example` domain. No real
 * customer data, live database, vendor account or network call appears
 * anywhere in it. */

          'Kestrel Lane Supply keeps customer accounts in two places: a legacy billing system that exports CSV, and a CRM with a paginated API. Write the two functions that load either source into one ledger of validated accounts.\n\n`applyCsv(ledger, csv)` returns `{ ledger, report }`. `applyApi(ledger, client)` returns a promise for the same shape. Both take the current ledger and return a new one, and neither writes into the ledger it was given.\n\n**Reading the sources**\n\n- CSV: `parseCsv(csv)` comes from the task harness and returns rows of strings, following RFC 4180; it skips empty lines. The first row is the header. Find `account_id`, `name`, `email` and `updated_at` by header name, after trimming and lowercasing each header cell. The columns come in any order, with extra columns you ignore. A row shorter than the header has `\'\'` in its missing cells. Number the data rows from 1: the first row after the header is `csv:1`.\n- API: call `client.listAccounts(null)`, then follow `nextCursor` until it is `null`. Each page is `{ accounts, nextCursor }`, and an empty page does not end the walk. Read `accountId`, `displayName`, `email` and `modifiedAt`. Number the accounts from 1 across all pages, in the order they arrived: `api:1`, `api:2` and on. If a call rejects, let that rejection reach your caller unchanged and do not retry it. Merge nothing until every page has arrived.\n\n**Validating a row.** A value that is not a string counts as `\'\'`. Trim every value, then check in this order and report only the first failure:\n\n1. `id`: uppercase it. An empty id is the rejection `missing-id`.\n2. `email`: lowercase it. It needs exactly one `@`, at least one character on each side, and no whitespace, or the rejection is `bad-email`.\n3. `updatedAt`: either `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` or `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ` with ASCII digits, both meaning UTC. Store it as `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`. Any other shape is `bad-timestamp`. Only the shape is checked, not the calendar.\n4. `name`: trimmed. An empty name is allowed.\n\nA valid row becomes exactly `{ id, name, email, updatedAt, source }`, with `source` set to `\'csv\'` or `\'api\'`.\n\n**Merging.** Take valid rows in input order. A row whose id is not in the ledger is added. A row whose id is already there replaces the stored record only when it is newer: a later `updatedAt`, or the same `updatedAt` with source `\'api\'` over a stored `\'csv\'` record, because the CRM is the system of record. Any other valid row is stale and changes nothing.\n\n**Reporting.** `report` is `{ source, read, applied, stale, rejected }`. `read` counts every data row or account, `applied` the rows that added or replaced a record, `stale` the valid rows that changed nothing, and `rejected` lists `{ ref, reason }` in input order. Every row lands in exactly one of the three, so `read === applied + stale + rejected.length`.\n\nReturn `ledger` sorted by `id`, comparing UTF-16 code units with `<` and `>`, so `ACC-10` sorts before `ACC-9`.\n\nLoad the two sources in either order, or replay either one, and the ledger comes out the same.\n\nInput bounds: at most 1,000 rows or accounts per call and at most 20 pages; string fields hold at most 200 UTF-16 code units; ordinary data objects with no getters or proxies. Rows from one source that share an id and an `updatedAt` carry the same name and email.\n\nTarget: O(n log n) time, where n is the number of rows read plus the records already in the ledger.\n\nThe CSV export, the API pages and every account in them are fixtures written for this exercise. `client` is an object literal in the task harness. Nothing opens a network connection, and no real customer data appears.',
