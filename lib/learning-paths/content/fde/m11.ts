 * M10 kept a model's proposal from acting with authority it does not have.
 * This module ships the result into somebody else's cloud account: their
 * network, their identity system, their change window and their database.
 * B9 renumbers the manifest later; until then the module keeps the id the
 * issue (#504) names, and every activity id carries it.
 *
 * Two lessons, one six-question check, one graded TypeScript release gate.
 * The first lesson reads a Dockerfile and the four cloud primitives a
 * customer's platform team asks about: compute, storage, networking and
 * identity, with the private endpoint that keeps traffic off the internet.
 * The second reads a Terraform plan, names the gates a release passes, and
 * prices a rollback after the schema moved.
 *
 * Everything here is an authored fixture. The Dockerfiles, the plan output,
 * the probe results, the migration ids and the restore point are written for
 * this path. Nothing calls a cloud API, needs a vendor account or opens a
 * socket. The lessons name one cloud's services so the vocabulary is concrete;
 * no check names a product as its answer. */

/** The release candidates and the recording log the gate is graded against.

 * replaces the fields a test names. `__log()` returns a log whose `record`
 * keeps a JSON copy of each entry, so a later change to an array the learner
 * returned cannot rewrite what was recorded. `__gate(overrides)` runs the gate
 * once against a fresh candidate and a fresh log and hands back both.

Probes for keys the release does not require never hold it. A reason names the key and never the value: values include secrets.\n3. **Migrations.** If `migrations` is `null`, the migration check never ran, and the reason is `migration:no-report`. An empty array means this release has no migrations. Every migration whose `status` is not exactly `applied` adds `migration:<id>:<status>`.
