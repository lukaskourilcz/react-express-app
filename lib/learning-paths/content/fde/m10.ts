/** M10 — Adoption and handoff.
 *
 * M09 got the thing running and gave you a way back when it broke. This
 * module is about the two people who inherit it: the operator who has to
 * press Approve on something a model proposed, and the on-call engineer who
 * opens your runbook at three in the morning having never seen the service.
 *
 * Two lessons, one four-question check, one graded exercise and three written
 * artifacts. The first lesson is the operator's screen: the four questions
 * an approval has to answer, and the states a happy-path demo never shows.
 * The second is acceptance, the demo, the runbook, the workshop that leaves
 * the customer's team able to maintain the thing, the written push-back on a
 * feature that will not move the customer's number, and the one recurring
 * need worth taking back to a product team.
 *
 * The three artifacts (runbook, workshop outline, push-back email) are
 * recorded as self-reviewed: the server confirms each required field is
 * present and inside its cap, nothing more. The module requires all three,
 * so guided completion waits for them. Their scenarios are fixtures stated in
 * each brief. The practitioner sources (Qureshi, The Pragmatic Engineer,
 * PostHog, and the Vercel posting) were read in October 2026 and
 * are cited for what they say, never as a hiring standard.
 *
 * This file becomes M13 when B9 renumbers the manifest; its id stays
 * `fde-v1-m10` until then, and every activity id keeps the v1 prefix.
 *
 * Two claims are repeated on purpose. A cancel stops the screen from acting
 * on an answer; it does not un-send a request that already left the browser,
 * and pretending otherwise is where the reconciliation bugs come from. And a
 * length check on a status message proves the message exists, which is not
 * the same as proving an operator can act on it — the exercise says so in the
 * criterion detail rather than letting the pass imply more than it earned.
 *
 * Everything the exercise touches is an authored fixture. `__fixture` in the
 * task harness builds a ticket proposal, two citations, a recording approval
 * endpoint and a recording live region; nothing calls a provider, needs a key
 * or opens a socket. Marlbrook Systems, ticket MB-3312, Northgate Dairy and
 * the `marlbrook.example` hostnames are invented for this path. No real
 * customer data, credential, company or person appears in any of it. */

import type { ModuleSource } from '../../types';

/** The proposal, the citations and the two recording dependencies the
 * operator-session exercise is graded against. Immutable helpers are provided
 * before learner declarations; deferred instrumentation initializes before calls.
 *
 * Delays run on the sandbox's virtual clock, so a 300 ms answer that arrives
 * after a 50 ms one finishes instantly and orders the same way on every run.
 * `__drain` waits past every fixture delay, which is how an assertion can ask
 * what the screen looked like once a late answer had its chance to land.
 * `__view` reads only the fields the grade covers, so a learner may keep
 * extra state without failing; `__voice` grades the live-region messages on
 * their own, because that criterion is not critical and must not be able to
 * drag the rest of the state down with it. */

You asked for a confidence percentage on every proposal, so operators
know which ones to check closely.

What we saw in UAT: operators opened the cited article on 9 of 10
proposals before approving. The two wrong proposals both cited a
superseded article. A score from the model is not calibrated against
your tickets, so 90% would not mean nine in ten are right.

What I recommend: mark a citation as superseded on the proposal itself,
and show the warnings the screen already receives. About three days.

What would change my mind: a labelled set of 200 of your tickets that
shows a score separating right from wrong proposals.

Decision: may we build the superseded marker instead? Support lead,

Under this exercise’s permissive warning policy, warnings are a partial failure: the status is still `ready`, the array is carried through unchanged, and approving stays possible. Dropping the warnings renders a clean success that is not true.\n- A load that rejects goes to `error`, keeps `ticketId`, clears the proposal and citations, and stores the rejection’s `message` in `error`.\n- `approve()` runs only from `ready` and only while `superseded` is false. It goes to `approving`, keeps the proposal and citations on screen, and calls `deps.submitApproval({ ticketId, revision })` with the loaded ticket id and the loaded proposal’s revision, and nothing else in the object. Resolving goes to `approved` with `receiptId`. Rejecting goes to `error` with the message, and the proposal stays on screen.\n- `reject()` runs only from `ready`. It goes to `rejected`, keeps the proposal and citations, and calls nothing.\n- `cancel()` runs only from `loading` or `approving`. It goes back to `idle`, clears everything, and pushes the in-flight request’s id onto `abandoned`.\n- `noteRevision(revision)` is the ticket service telling the screen the ticket has moved. From `ready`, when the number is greater than the loaded proposal’s revision, set `superseded` to true. If already superseded, or in any other case, it changes nothing.\n\nThe part that matters most: after a cancel, or after the screen has moved on to another request, the answer to the abandoned request can still arrive. It has to change nothing at all — no status, no proposal, no receipt, no announcement. Give every request an id, remember which id you are still willing to accept an answer from, and have both handlers return early when the id they carry is not that one.\n\nAnnounce on every state change and on every refused operator action, by setting `statusMessage` and calling `deps.announce(message)` with the same string. A `noteRevision` that changes nothing announces nothing. The selected checks count announcements and compare the last message; they establish those tested transitions, not every possible path or real assistive-technology delivery. Wording and accessibility need separate review.\n\nDomain: dependencies and results are trusted ordinary data. load/approval return settling promises without synchronous throws, announce is a nonthrowing recorder, revisions are nonnegative safe integers, ticket/receipt ids are nonempty strings and error messages are strings including empty. Each session receives at most 100 actions and arrays contain at most 100 entries. getState returns a fresh top-level snapshot; callers read nested data without mutating it. Request ids start at 1, increase for each accepted load/approval and are never reused; refused actions do not allocate ids. The immutable fixture helpers are available before declarations, with deferred instrumentation before graded calls. This stateful contract has an explicit action budget rather than a single input-size complexity target.\n\nCancelling stops the screen from acting on the answer. It does not un-send a request that already left, and one of the assertions holds you to that: the approval still reaches `deps.submitApproval`, and the screen simply refuses to claim it knows the outcome.',

        brief:
          'After the UAT, Marlbrook’s VP of Customer Operations writes to you: “Operators are too slow. UAT says six minutes twenty against a four-minute target. Turn off the approval step for refunds under EUR 50 and let the workbench send them. Can it be live next week?”\n\nWhat the fixtures give you. The UAT ran ten cases. In seven of them the operator reloaded the ticket before approving, to check whether it had changed since the proposal was built; the session notes put the median time spent on those reloads at two minutes ten seconds per case. The UAT build tracked the ticket-moved state from this module’s exercise, but Marlbrook’s ticket service was not yet sending it revision events, so the screen never marked a ticket as moved. The screen also does not show when a proposal was built. Refunds become irreversible once the payment provider accepts them. Since discovery, finance has named an approver and an amount limit for refunds an operator approves, and nobody for refunds sent without a person. Use only these facts; where you would need a number you do not have, say so.\n\nWrite the email. Five fields, all required, each with a character limit you can see before you type: the subject line (120), the request restated in the VP’s words (400), the need behind it and your evidence (1,000), your recommendation with its cost and the condition that would make you build what they asked (1,000), and the one decision you ask for, from whom and by when (300). You review it against two rows of the path rubric, shown beside the form: communication and problem framing.\n\nMarlbrook, its VP and its numbers are fixtures written for this module, and no email is sent. This submission is recorded as self-reviewed. The automated check confirms that each field is present and inside its limit; it cannot tell whether the VP would agree or whether your tone would keep the conversation open. Read it as the VP would, against the rubric, before you submit.',
