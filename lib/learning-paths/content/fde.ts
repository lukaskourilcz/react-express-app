/** Forward Deployed Engineer: the optional role specialization.
 *
 * It sits above the existing Fullstack, Frontend and Backend tracks rather
 * than beside them — one shared curriculum, with the base track changing only
 * which bridges get recommended. Completion describes performance in
 * devShark's exercises. It is not a certification, not evidence of production
 * experience, and not a hiring claim.
 *
 * This file carries the path metadata and assembles the modules. Module
 * bodies live one file per module under `./fde/`; Czech copy lives in the
 * `.cs` siblings; reference solutions and hidden assertions live under
 * `lib/learning-paths/solutions/`.
 *
 * The core path needs no paid API, no vendor account and no live model. Model
 * responses, retrieval results and tool traffic are synthetic fixtures, and
 * every module says so where a learner might otherwise assume a live system. */

  summary:
    'Ten modules and a staged capstone on the work that sits between a customer’s messy problem and a system that survives contact with it: scoping, integration, bounded AI, evaluation, security, operations and handoff. It assumes you can already build software, and it grades the judgement rather than the syntax.',
  outcomes: [
    'Turn an ambiguous customer request into a scope with a baseline, a measurable success condition and stated non-goals.',
    'Integrate a real-shaped external system: dirty records, pagination, throttling, duplicate delivery and identity boundaries.',
