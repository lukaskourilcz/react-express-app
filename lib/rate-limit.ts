// Rate limiter for the Vercel serverless API.
//
// Two backends behind one entrypoint, `enforceRateLimit()`:
//
//   1. Upstash Redis (distributed) — used automatically when
//      UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL + UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN are set. This is the
//      real limit: it holds across every cold serverless instance, closing the
//      gap the in-memory limiter can't (a burst spread over many fresh
//      instances). Recommended for production.
//
//   2. In-memory token bucket (`checkRateLimit`) — the fallback used when
//      Upstash isn't configured, or if a Redis call fails so we never hard-fail
//      a request on the limiter. Buckets are keyed per (endpoint, caller): the
//      identity a handler passes, always `user:<verified id>`, or the client
//      IP when it passes none. They live in the module's Map, which persists
//      across warm invocations of the same instance. Not distributed, but
//      enough to blunt the "one script hammering one endpoint" abuse the app
//      cares about (leaderboard spam, report spam, admin-password guessing).
//
// Callers should prefer `await enforceRateLimit(...)`; `checkRateLimit()` stays
// exported for the fallback path and any sync call site.
