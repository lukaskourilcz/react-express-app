/**
 * Ten test friends, as SQL.
 *
 *   npm run seed:test-friends -- --owner <user_id> > /tmp/seed.sql
 *
 * Why a generator and not a fixture: the ten accounts have to be *different
 * distances along*, and stating a streak, an XP total, an answered count and a
 * per-topic level map by hand for ten people is where fixtures start quietly
 * contradicting themselves — an 88% accuracy with four correct answers, a level
 * 6 in a topic with no answers in it. Here the profile is the input and every
 * derived row is computed from it, so the numbers agree by construction.
 *
 * Deterministic on purpose. No clock, no randomness, no network: the same
 * command produces byte-identical SQL, so re-running it is a diff you can read
 * rather than a fresh set of strangers. Dates are the one thing that must move,
 * and they are anchored to the database's own CURRENT_DATE inside the SQL
 * rather than to this process's clock, so a seed applied next month still has a
 * friend who studied "today".
 *
 * These are not real people and nothing pretends they are. The ids all begin
 * `seed-friend-`, which is what makes them findable and removable in one
 * statement — the file ends with that statement, commented out.
 *
 * Scope: writing these rows puts ten accounts into whatever database the SQL is
 * applied to, including the public leaderboard, which the owner asked for. They
 * hold no email, no name and no auth user; they exist only as progress rows and
 * a handle.
