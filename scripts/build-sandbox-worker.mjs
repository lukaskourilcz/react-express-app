// Bundles the QuickJS grader's worker thread (scripts/sandbox-worker-entry.ts)
// into one self-contained CommonJS file. QuickJS and its WebAssembly are
// inside it, so the deployed function needs nothing from node_modules to
// start the thread. build-react-runner.mjs runs this on every build, and the
// suites that grade code run it first so they exercise the same thread.
//
// It also bundles the TypeScript checker's worker thread
// (scripts/ts-check-worker-entry.ts, lib/coding/ts-check-pool.ts). The
// compiler stays in node_modules, where the roadmap function already has it.
