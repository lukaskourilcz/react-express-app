Scaffold a migration for `$ARGUMENTS` by following `.claude/skills/supabase-migration/SKILL.md`. Read the skill first; this command writes the empty shapes, and you fill them.

1. Inspect `git status --short` and `git fetch origin main`. Preserve unrelated work.
2. Take the next migration number: the highest `supabase/supabase-schema-NNN.sql` here or on `origin/main`, plus one, padded to three digits. Take the next test number the same way from `supabase/tests/NNN-*.test.sql`. Build a kebab-case slug of three to five words from the purpose.
3. Write `supabase/supabase-schema-<NNN>.sql` with the header and the transaction, and nothing between them yet:

   ```sql
   -- Migration <NNN>: <purpose, one sentence>. Apply after migration <NNN-1 or --after>.
   -- Safe to re-run; the whole file is one transaction. Compatible with the code
   -- in production (<git rev-parse --short origin/main>): <fill in>.
   BEGIN;

   COMMIT;
   ```

4. Write `supabase/tests/<test number>-<slug>.test.sql`:

   ```sql
   -- Migration <NNN>: <purpose>. STUB: replace the assertion below with the
   -- behaviour the migration adds before the pull request opens.
   SET LOCAL ROLE service_role;
   DO $$
   BEGIN
     ASSERT current_setting('plpgsql.check_asserts') = 'on', 'test:sql runs with assertions on';
   END;
   $$;
   ```

5. Add an unticked item to `NEEDED.md`, in the section of the work the migration belongs to, using the skill's wording and markers:

   ```md
   - [ ] **Apply migration <NNN> before the <feature> deploy** — `supabase/supabase-schema-<NNN>.sql` (<what it adds>). Apply it after <NNN-1>; the code in production keeps working with it applied, and the new code needs it. [imp:4] [owner:me] [time:5m] [kind:deploy]
   ```

6. Prove the scaffold on an empty database. Pick a free host port; the script refuses a database that already has tables, so remove the container after the run:

   ```sh
   docker run -d --name devshark-sql -p 54339:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres supabase/postgres:17.6.1.171
   until docker exec devshark-sql pg_isready -U postgres -h 127.0.0.1; do sleep 2; done
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54339/postgres npm run test:sql
   psql postgres://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54339/postgres -X -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f supabase/supabase-schema-<NNN>.sql
   docker rm -f devshark-sql
   git diff --check
   ```

7. Then write the body (skill section 2), the `_v2` routine and its `isRpcMissing` fallback when the change alters a routine production calls (section 3), the real assertions (section 4) and the `docs/product-architecture.md` sentence (section 5). Rerun step 6 on a fresh container after each change to the SQL.

Report the three paths, the two numbers, the `Applied N schema files` line and the summary line `test:sql` printed, and the result of the second apply and of `git diff --check`. Leave the files uncommitted unless the caller asked for a commit. Do not apply anything to a Supabase project: the owner, or an agent the owner authorised for this migration, does that before the code merges (skill section 6).
