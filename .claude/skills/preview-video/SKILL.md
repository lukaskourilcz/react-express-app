# Preview Video — animated scroll capture

Generates a smooth-scroll recording of the deployed project (Refero-style) and saves it to `media/`.

## Prerequisites

- `ffmpeg` available on PATH (`ffmpeg -version`)
- Playwright Chromium installed: `npx playwright install chromium` (once per machine)

## Steps

1. Open `preview.config.json` in this skill folder and verify `url` is still correct.
   For local capture set `devServer` (e.g. `{ "command": "npm run dev", "port": 3000 }`)
   and point `url` to `http://localhost:<port>`.
2. From the repo root run:
   `npx -y tsx .claude/skills/preview-video/scripts/capture-preview.ts`
3. QA: open `media/preview-poster.png` and 2–3 frames from the temp dir printed by the
   script. Verify: no cookie banners or chat widgets (add offending selectors to
   `hideSelectors` and re-run), fonts and images fully loaded, scroll reaches the footer.
4. Check sizes: `preview.webm` ≤ ~4 MB, `preview.mp4` ≤ ~6 MB. If larger, raise the
   webm CRF (34 → 38) in the script call or set `deviceScaleFactor` to 1.
5. Commit the regenerated files in `media/`.

## Troubleshooting

- Smooth-scroll libraries (Lenis, Locomotive, GSAP ScrollTrigger) hijacking the scroll:
  the injected `scroll-behavior: auto` usually fixes it; otherwise disable the library
  for capture via `extraCss` or an env flag in the app.
- Fixed-shell SPA where the window itself does not scroll (an inner `<main>` or a
  panel scrolls instead, so the capture comes out static): set `scrollSelector` in the
  config to that container's CSS selector (e.g. `"main"`). Leave it out for normal pages.
- Blank sections in frames: increase `waitAfterLoadMs`, or slow down the lazy-load
  pre-scroll (raise its per-step timeout in the script).
- `networkidle` never settles (analytics polling): harmless — the script falls back
  after 10 s.
- Need a GIF (e.g. for a README): set `"gif": true` and re-run.

## Environment overrides (advanced)

The script reads a few optional environment variables. All are no-ops when unset, so a
normal local run behaves exactly as described above. They exist so the same script can
run behind a restricted network (e.g. a CI sandbox whose browser egress must go through a
proxy):

- `CAPTURE_PROXY_SERVER` — route the browser through an HTTP proxy, e.g.
  `http://127.0.0.1:8899`. Use a local TLS-terminating bridge (mitmproxy in
  `upstream` mode) when the environment only exposes a policy-enforcing egress proxy.
- `CAPTURE_INSECURE=1` — ignore TLS certificate errors. Only meaningful together with a
  re-signing MITM proxy; never needed for a direct connection.
- `CAPTURE_EXTRA_ARGS` — extra comma-separated Chromium flags.

`--no-sandbox` is added automatically when the script runs as root (required by Chromium),
and `--disable-quic` is always set to keep HTTP-proxy captures reliable.

## Hand-off to the portfolio

This recording is also the animated thumbnail for this project on
lukaskouril.dev. After regenerating it, copy all three files into the portfolio
repository:

```
media/preview.webm        →  nxt-portfolio/public/previews/devshark/preview.webm
media/preview.mp4         →  nxt-portfolio/public/previews/devshark/preview.mp4
media/preview-poster.png  →  nxt-portfolio/public/previews/devshark/preview-poster.png
```

The directory name is the portfolio work item's `id`, which is not always the
repository name. Keep the three files together: the portfolio sets
`preload="none"`, so the poster is the only thing shown until playback starts,
and a stale poster is what reduced-motion visitors and search engines see.

Budget for the portfolio homepage: webm under ~1 MB, mp4 under ~1.5 MB, poster
under ~600 KB. Raise the webm CRF from 34 toward 38 if the clip runs over.

Record only surfaces a logged-out visitor can reach, so no private data is
filmed. See `nxt-portfolio/.claude/skills/preview-video/SKILL.md` for the full
ingestion procedure.

## Capturing devShark locally

`preview.config.json` points at the deployed site, which is the right default.
When the deployment is unreachable, run the client instead — but devShark is a
locked deployment of the same client, so the lock has to be set or the capture
comes out as the StudyShark landing page wearing a devShark header:

```sh
cd client && VITE_PRODUCT=devshark VITE_LOCK_SUBJECT=webdev npm run dev -- --port 5174
```

Then set `"url": "http://localhost:5174/"` for the run. Check the poster before
committing: the hero must read "Become a developer, one level at a time" over
the green devShark palette, not the orange StudyShark one.
