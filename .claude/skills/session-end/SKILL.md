# session-end

Run before **ending** an agentic session on this repo.

1. Update `NEEDED.md`: tick off (`- [x]`) anything finished this session, and add
   any newly-discovered items that need the **owner** as `[owner:me]` tasks.
2. Keep every task's markers intact and in the shared format (below). Give new
   tasks an `[imp:N]`, `[owner:…]`, `[time:…]`, and `[kind:…]`.
3. If the stack, cost, or monetization picture changed, note it in
   `about-project.md`, `scaling.md`, or `monetization.md`.

## NEEDED.md marker format (shared across all repos)

`- [ ] **Title** — desc. [imp:1-5] [owner:me|ai] [time:30m] [kind:K]`
`[kind:K]` ∈ `setup` `deploy` `legal` `content` `decision`.
