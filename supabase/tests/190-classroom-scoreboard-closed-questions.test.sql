-- While a classroom room runs, its scoreboard counts only closed questions
-- (migration 056, owner decision 6 of 1 Oct 2026). match_scoreboard takes
-- p_before_idx and then counts only the answers to earlier questions;
-- api/play/[action].ts passes the current index, or the next one once the
-- teacher revealed the current question (matches.revealed_idx) or its clock
-- ran out. Without the argument it counts every answer, as before, which is
-- what a multiplayer room and a finished one get. A participant with nothing
-- counted keeps a row of zeros. The handler's refusal of an answer to a
-- revealed question is in scripts/test-play-rooms.ts.
