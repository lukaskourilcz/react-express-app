-- Shark Cards (owner decision 12, 1 October 2026). A Shark Card is now a
-- saved question (public.flashcards), and the collectible card packs are
-- retired: nothing calls grant_daily_queue_cards any more, but the user_cards
-- table and its rows stay. Deleting an account still erases both, and only
-- that account's rows.
